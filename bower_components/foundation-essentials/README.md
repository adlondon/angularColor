foundation-essentials
=====================

A Bower Package for Foundation 5 Essentials
  - Remove !importants from the CSS
  - Pair down sub-component dependencies, unspaghettifying
  - Convert files into scss that can be appended to an app sass file

ZURB makes all this stuff, all I do is make the essential removals and maintain the package.json file
